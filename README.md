# Inversity.gds.project
Github repo for the inversity challenge involving government services 


In my project I have written a piece of code that allows the user to save any personal information they want which if the personal information is then required in a gov.uk service it will automatically fill the tab space with this information as one of the main problems with users was that they felt that it was very straining by typing out personal information every time. Alongside this I have also created  a feature that will recommend types of service on gov.uk related to (or the next steps) to the service that they just completed.  

The main problems I was trying to solve were: 

Saving personal information 

Recommending services based off user activity 

# features

Feature 1: My main feature to improving the Gov.uk website is creating a tab that holds the users person information so that the user experience is enhanced and it is easy to use by clicking a tab that sends the user to a page which displays their personal information.
Feature 2: Another feature is a tab that shows the recent activity history of the user and it shiws this to the user by them clicking a tab on the home page 
Feature 3: Another feature is that once a activity has been completed the user will get recommended services based on what they have completed and again this can be opened by a clicing of a tab on the home page
Feature 4: and finally improvements to the layout of the home page

# limitations 
Claude AI doesnt give you unlimited uses so with a limited time achieving the website was found to be difficult 
It was also quite diificult to get an exact copy of what you wanted your website to look like as the AI didnt know
I had an idea to add an AI Chatbot but i didnt have enough time 

# Credits
Claude AI - helped me to get some ideas of what i wanted the website to look like 
ChatGPT - helped with the pages and the uses of my gov.uk website
